          <p>Tattooing has long been a practice tied to pilgrimage and religious devotion in Jerusalem, with some dating the tradition back centuries. But today, it’s not just pilgrims—artists like Isaac, a local tattooist, are finding ways to turn faith into body art that represents both belief and survival.</p>
